**MELRESCAR** is a C# Windows Forms application that streamlines rental management for companies offering cars, trucks, vans, and motorbikes.

It was built with two colleagues to efficiently handle client and employee information, vehicle rentals, and maintenance scheduling.

## Key Features:

- **Manage Clients, Employees, and Vehicles:** Easily manage clients, employees, and various types of vehicles including cars, trucks, vans, and motorbikes.
- **Schedule Rentals and Maintenance:** Schedule rentals for vehicles as well as maintenance tasks for keeping the fleet in optimal condition.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Intuitive interface for easy navigation and efficient usage.
- **Data Persistence:** All data is saved in simple CSV files for easy access and maintenance.

## Date Simulator:

MELRESCAR includes a date simulator feature that provides notifications when vehicles are ready to use. This feature utilizes a scheduler or timer mechanism to track scheduled rentals and maintenance tasks. When a vehicle becomes available for rental or maintenance is completed, the system sends a notification to alert the user.
